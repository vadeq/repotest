- snapshot Designstate Config for Agile
  designstate user
  roles
  part and document subclasses
  etc..

- user authentication for transferring data into Agile:
  use logged in end user?
  use static system user:

- Part number convention
  when moving files from Intralink:
  do special characters need to be mapped (i.e. "_" etc)
  can we use the same naming convention for intralink and all others?
